## Instructions:

#### "main.cpp" is the main file from which all sorting algorithms are called. It generates n(specified by user) random numbers between 0 and 1000 and stores them in array/link list (specified by user).
#### To sort these n numbers by a specified algorithm  uncomment 3 lines specified for that algorithm in main.cpp
#### Then compile as follows:
<code> g++ main.cpp <algo_name>.cpp </code>
